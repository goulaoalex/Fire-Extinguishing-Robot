# Fire-Extinguishing-Robot
My project in the Fire Extinguishing competition. Contains code, diagram of the connections and power supply and some images of the robot.

The arduino controlled mobile robot will run through a determined course, by following the wall to it's right, using an ultrassonic sensor.
The objective is to find a lit candle and extinguish it's flame.

In the next image you can an image of the mobile robot.
